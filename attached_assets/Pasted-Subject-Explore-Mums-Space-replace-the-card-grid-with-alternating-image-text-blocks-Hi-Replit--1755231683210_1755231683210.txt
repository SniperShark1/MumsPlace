Subject: Explore Mums Space — replace the card grid with alternating image + text blocks

Hi Replit,

This is the third request for the Explore page. Please remove the current card/grid layout entirely and replace it with alternating image + text sections as specified below.

What to build (no deviations)

Keep the page H1: Explore Mums Space.

Under the H1, replace everything with a sequence of sections.

Each section =

Heading (section name)

One-line description (use the exact copy below)

Illustrative image (right side for odd sections, left side for even sections; alternate all the way down)

CTA link on the text side that routes to the correct area (see link targets below).

No system/browser popups anywhere on this page.

Delete the “Test Feature” label and remove the old tiles.

Layout requirements

Alternating layout: Section 1 image right, Section 2 image left, Section 3 image right, etc. Continue this pattern.

Spacing: Consistent vertical rhythm; clear separation between sections; no overlapping text.

Mobile: Stack vertically (text first, image second).

Tablet/Desktop: Two columns; text ~60%, image ~40%.

Images: Use clean, relevant visuals (placeholder is fine). Include meaningful alt text.

Acceptance checklist (what I will check)

The old card grid is gone and no “Test Feature” text remains.

Every section shows: heading, one-liner, alternating image placement, and a working CTA.

On mobile, sections stack cleanly (no cropped text/images).

No browser-native alert/confirm/prompt dialogs on this page.

All links navigate to the paths above.

Please confirm when this is implemented exactly as written. If anything is unclear, ask before building—don’t improvise.

Thanks.
